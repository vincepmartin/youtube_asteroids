## Me

I get this cors error, even when running on a local web server...

Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://jon.swelter.net/f92bf26eba53cf04a.json. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing). Status code: 200.

### Reasoning

The user is getting a CORS error when trying to access a resource at `https://jon.swelter.net/f92bf26eba53cf04a.json` even when running on a local web server. The error message indicates that the CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' is missing from the response.

This is a common issue when making cross-origin requests from a web application. Even though they're running a local web server, they're still making a request to a different domain (jon.swelter.net), which triggers CORS policy.

Let me provide some solutions for this:

1. Server-side solution: Add CORS headers to the server serving the JSON file
2. Client-side workarounds: Use a proxy, JSONP (if supported), or server-side fetch
3. Development solutions: Use browser flags or CORS proxy services

I should provide practical solutions they can implement.

### Response

This CORS error occurs because you're making a cross-origin request from your local server to `https://jon.swelter.net`. Here are several solutions:

## Server-side Solution (Recommended)

If you control the server at `jon.swelter.net`, add CORS headers:

```javascript
// Express.js example
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type");
  next();
});
```

## Client-side Workarounds

### 1. Proxy through your local server

```javascript
// In your local server
app.get("/api/data", async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://jon.swelter.net/f92bf26eba53cf04a.json",
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  res.json(data);
});

// In your frontend
fetch("/api/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

### 2. Use a CORS proxy service

```javascript
fetch(
  "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://jon.swelter.net/f92bf26eba53cf04a.json",
)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

## Development-only Solutions

- Use Chrome with `--disable-web-security --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome_dev`
- Install a CORS browser extension

The proxy solution is most reliable for production use. Would you like me to help implement a specific proxy setup for your local server?

Give me a solution that doesn't involve a backend please. @{full_stack_dev}

### Reasoning

The user is getting a CORS error when trying to fetch from https://jon.swelter.net/f92bf26eba53cf04a.json from their local web server. They want a solution that doesn't involve a backend, and they've listed the available tools.

Since they don't want a backend solution, I need to look at frontend-only approaches. Let me first check what files they have in their project to understand the current setup.

The most common frontend-only solutions for CORS issues are:

1. JSONP (if the API supports it)
2. Using a public CORS proxy
3. Downloading the JSON file locally and serving it from the same origin
4. Using a development server with proxy configuration

Let me start by exploring their current project structure to understand what they're working with.

### Response

Let me first check your project structure to understand your setup and then provide a frontend-only CORS solution.

Read file `asteroids.html`

I can see you have an asteroids game that's trying to fetch JSON data from `https://jon.swelter.net/f92bf26eba53cf04a.json`. Here are frontend-only solutions for the CORS issue:

## Solution 1: Download and serve the JSON locally

Let me fetch the JSON file and create a local copy:

`curl -s "https://jon.swelter.net/f92bf26eba53cf04a.json" > youtube_data.json`

```

```

Now update your HTML to use the local file instead:

Edited `asteroids.html`
Update the default URL input value to use the local JSON file instead of the remote URL

## Solution 2: Use a public CORS proxy

Alternatively, you can modify the fetch function to use a CORS proxy:

Error editing `asteroids.html`
